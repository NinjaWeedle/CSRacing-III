### Graphics Template

This is a template for programs that use the [TI-84 Plus CE C/C++ Toolchain](https://github.com/CE-Programming/toolchain).
You can clone this directory for your own graphx-based projects.
Note that for non-graphical programs that do not use the graphx library, it is better to start from the
[non-graphx template](https://github.com/CE-Programming/template) instead.

To add code, fill in the begin, end, step, and draw functions in main.c.

For more information, see the [toolchain's documentation](https://ce-programming.github.io/toolchain/index.html).
